# Sierpinski-Gasket
An app that runs on a web server that allows for the user to create cubes, tetrahedrons, triangular prisms, and octahedrons.

Make sure all of the files are in the same directory.
Open SierpinskiGasket.html in a web browser. You can do this from a directory or an editor.

Once you have it opened:
Click on a shape that you want to make. You can scale this, move it around, and rotate on all 3 axis.
Only the most recently added shape can be moved around by clicking and dragging the shape.
The shape inverts when it is scaled down to a certain point.
If the shape is scaled too much, then the user will see the inside of it.
